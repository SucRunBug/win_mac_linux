## IELTS speaking part 2

- ﻿﻿3 to 4 minutes
- ﻿﻿1 minute to prepare
- ﻿﻿speak for 2 minutes
- ﻿﻿task card
- ﻿﻿describe..



Make notes:

Quickly decide what you're going to talk about.



Technique:

Follow the points on the task card. They help your structure and give you something to say. Say as much as you can for each point.



Before the exam:

Prepare for common topic areas

Vocabulary and ideas are the key



Topics, techniques, vocabulary, example question

### 6 main topic areas:

Describe a person/ a place/ an object/ an event/ an activity/ your favourites

Prepare ideas and vocabulary

not grammar or linking

Speak naturally, explain in detail content, not structure



#### Describe a person

- ﻿﻿teacher
- ﻿﻿famous person
- ﻿﻿friend
- ﻿﻿family member
- ﻿﻿child
- ﻿﻿someone who helps people
- ﻿﻿someone who does something well



- ﻿who (appearance, personality)
- ﻿what he / she does

- when / how / where you met

- ﻿﻿how you know about this person
- ﻿﻿why you like this person

Preparation tip:

- ﻿﻿think of a 'theme' for any person (friend, family, famous, child etc.)
- ﻿﻿start with easy adjectives 
- search for better words and phrases

主题是指可以用一个整体的词概括此人，例如hard-working，然后根据主题列举简单的形容词，例如busy, active，之后再找到更好的词替换，例如conscientious, someone you can count on

这些词不是主题的同义词，而是与主题相关的词汇。

hard-working 'theme':

- ﻿﻿enthusiastic
- ﻿﻿energetic
- ﻿﻿studious
- ﻿﻿persistent
- ﻿﻿motivated
- ﻿﻿determined to succeed someone who sees things through
- ﻿﻿a good team player
- ﻿﻿likes to challenge himself / herself

friendly 'theme':

- kind, caring

- generous, unselfish

- ﻿big-hearted
- ﻿﻿supportive
- ﻿﻿down-to-earth, easy-going
- ﻿﻿always there when you need him / her
- ﻿﻿someone who cheers me up
- ﻿﻿a big / magnetic personality
- ﻿﻿lights up the room

Final step in preparation: 

Think of examples or stories to demonstrate each theme.
My brother is hard-working: 1 remember when he used to get up at 5am to do some extra work before school...

You can't prepare for everything 

you will need to adapt your ideas and improvise in the test

Practise, record, improve
