# IELTS writing task 1

## Lesson 1

Remember:

The task is to describe what you see. Write a report. **Don't give opinions.**

**No conclusion.** Instead write a summary (the overview).



### Question types

1. ﻿﻿﻿Line graph
2. ﻿﻿﻿Bar chart
3. ﻿﻿﻿Pie chart
4. ﻿﻿﻿Table
5. ﻿﻿﻿Diagram - comparing
6. ﻿﻿﻿Diagram - process



前四种类型，主要是the numbers of describe, compare, trends/changes



### Essay structure

1. ﻿﻿﻿Introduction
2. ﻿﻿﻿Overview
3. ﻿﻿﻿Details
4. ﻿﻿﻿Details

可以把overview放在最后，没有conclusion

但simon老师倾向于将overview放在第二部分，因为这部分对得分很有帮助。

#### Introduction

One sentence:

Paraphrase the question

改变关键词，改变描述语序

#### ﻿﻿Overview

2 sentences:

The main, general things

#### Details

Why 2 paragraphs? This makes you organise or 'group' the information better





## Lesson 2 Line graphs

Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4 or 5 lines.

Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

### First

make a very general comparison.(summary / overview paragraph)

eg. higer overall (is higher than the other lines overall) 总体上更高

### Second

compare the lines at specific points ('details' paragraphs)

eg. 比较一下第一年的所有数据，或者其它你认为重要的地方，或者交汇点，或者峰值 peak，或者稳定的时期 stable period，描述曲线的上升程度

4 lines: you can't describe everything, write at least one thing about each line.



### 例子

#### Introduction - paraphrase the question

示例：

题目是 The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

可以修改为 The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years. 作为introduction



#### Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

举例说明，列举整个图表中最突出的线，整个时期中最高或者最低，这里就可以写两个点。

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.



#### Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

##### 第三段

比如可以比较一下最初的年份下的数据，描述有重要意义的线段的交汇处。

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a **negligible** amount. Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

现在在中途给出描述数字时的tips:

Important tip when describing numbers

You can't write:

- ﻿﻿Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- ﻿﻿Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

You must write:

- ﻿﻿Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- ﻿﻿Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

有时候需要思考正确的表达方式。	

##### 第四段

可以找到某一线段的极值，然后和其它某一线段进行对比。描述一下其它线段的增幅状态。

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

#### 词汇短语总结

- ﻿amount of electricity produced
- ﻿﻿source of / provided / generating
- ﻿﻿means of electricity generation
- ﻿﻿over a period of / over the period shown
- ﻿﻿by far the most important
- ﻿﻿a negligible amount
- ﻿﻿nuclear power overtook thermal power
- ﻿﻿as the primary source of electricity
- ﻿﻿rose dramatically to a peak of
- ﻿﻿by contrast the figure for
- ﻿﻿remained at this level, remained stabl
- ﻿saw only a small ris



## Lesson 3 Bar charts

Bar charts can show numbers changing over a period of time.

This type of bar chart is the same as a line graph.



However! Bar charts don't always show time...
they often only compare numbers



Your job is to compare the bars.



First, make a very general comparison
(summary / overview paragraph)

可以谈论最值或者相似的值



Second, compare specific numbers
(details' paragraphs)



### 例子

#### Introduction - paraphrase the question 

The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.

The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular
manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.

#### Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

描述最高的数值和增长的趋势。

It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. ;Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year period.



#### Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the bars

第三段可以比较某两个具体的项目。

Paragraph 3: **comparisons**, <u>changes over time</u>

In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was **almost double** the number of handsets sold by the **second most successful** manufacturer, Samsung. <u>Over the following four years</u>, however, Nokia's <u>sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units</u>, **whereas** Samsung <u>saw sales rise by a similar amount</u>. By 2013, Samsung **had become the market leader** with sales reaching 450 million units.

第四段可以结合剩余项目进行比较。

Paragraph 4: **comparisons**, <u>changes over time</u>

The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were **LG, ZTE and Apple**. In 2009, **these companies sold** around 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets **respectively**, <u>but **Apple overtook the other two** vendors in 2011</u>. In 2013, <u>purchases of Apple handsets reached</u> 150 million units, **while** <u>LG saw declining sales</u> **and** the <u>figures for ZTE rose only slightly.</u>
