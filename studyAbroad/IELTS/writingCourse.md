# IELTS writing task 1

## Lesson 1

Remember:

The task is to describe what you see. Write a report. **Don't give opinions.**

**No conclusion.** Instead write a summary (the overview).



### Question types

1. ﻿﻿﻿Line graph
2. ﻿﻿﻿Bar chart
3. ﻿﻿﻿Pie chart
4. ﻿﻿﻿Table
5. ﻿﻿﻿Diagram - comparing
6. ﻿﻿﻿Diagram - process



前四种类型，主要是the numbers of describe, compare, trends/changes



### Essay structure

1. ﻿﻿﻿Introduction
2. ﻿﻿﻿Overview
3. ﻿﻿﻿Details
4. ﻿﻿﻿Details

可以把overview放在最后，没有conclusion

但simon老师倾向于将overview放在第二部分，因为这部分对得分很有帮助。

#### Introduction

One sentence:

Paraphrase the question

改变关键词，改变描述语序

#### ﻿﻿Overview

2 sentences:

The main, general things

#### Details

Why 2 paragraphs? This makes you organise or 'group' the information better





## Lesson 2 Line graphs

Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4 or 5 lines.

Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

### First

make a very general comparison.(summary / overview paragraph)

eg. higer overall (is higher than the other lines overall) 总体上更高

### Second

compare the lines at specific points ('details' paragraphs)

eg. 比较一下第一年的所有数据，或者其它你认为重要的地方，或者交汇点，或者峰值 peak，或者稳定的时期 stable period，描述曲线的上升程度

4 lines: you can't describe everything, write at least one thing about each line.



### 例子

#### Introduction - paraphrase the question

示例：

题目是 The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

可以修改为 The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years. 作为introduction



#### Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

举例说明，列举整个图表中最突出的线，整个时期中最高或者最低，这里就可以写两个点。

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.



#### Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

##### 第三段

比如可以比较一下最初的年份下的数据，描述有重要意义的线段的交汇处。

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a **negligible** amount. Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

现在在中途给出描述数字时的tips:

Important tip when describing numbers

You can't write:

- ﻿﻿Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- ﻿﻿Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

You must write:

- ﻿﻿Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- ﻿﻿Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

有时候需要思考正确的表达方式。	

##### 第四段

可以找到某一线段的极值，然后和其它某一线段进行对比。描述一下其它线段的增幅状态。

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
