This small note references Simon's class, i watch the privated copies viedo from bilibili, so, sorry Mr. Simon, i will try my best to study.

## Kown the test

- about 30 minutes
- extra 10 minutes at the end
- 40 questions (get 30 right to 7 point)
- 4 sections of 10 questions
- answers are always in order
- only 3 main types of question (gap filling, multiple choice, matching)
- various English accent (don't worry, that will be slow)

You only hear the recordings once!

do some real practice tests

### Section 1

- two speakers
- ﻿﻿an 'everyday' conversation e.g. making a booking
- ﻿﻿one speaker gives basic information
- ﻿﻿simple gap-fill: missing details
- ﻿﻿names, addresses, dates, times, numbers
- ﻿﻿section 1 is easy, but you need a high score (9 or 10 correct)

### Key technique!

Use the breaks to read ahead

- ﻿﻿before each section starts
- ﻿﻿in the middle of each section (except in section 4)
- ﻿﻿at the end of each section

Don't check back, read ahead

### Section 2

- use all of the break time at the end of section 1
- ﻿﻿one speaker only
- ﻿﻿a short speech about a non-academic topic e.g. tourism, a park, local facilities
- ﻿﻿gap-fill, multiple choice, matching
- ﻿﻿break in the middle
- ﻿still quite easy, aim for a high score

### Section 3

- use breaks to read and underline
- ﻿﻿two or three speakers
- ﻿﻿conversation related to education or training e.g. tutor and student
- ﻿﻿gap-fill, multiple choice (difficult)
- ﻿﻿underline keywords in questions and choices
- ﻿﻿listen for keywords or synonyms
- ﻿﻿difficult section, aim for 6 or 7

### Section 4

- use break at the end of section 3
- ﻿﻿underline keywords
- ﻿﻿no break in the middle!
- ﻿﻿one speaker only
- ﻿﻿speech about an academic topic
- ﻿﻿gap-fill, multiple choice
- ﻿﻿listen for keywords or synonyms
- ﻿﻿difficult: faster speech, more content, extra information
