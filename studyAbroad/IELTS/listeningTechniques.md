This small note references Simon's class, i watch the privated copies viedo from bilibili, so, sorry Mr. Simon, i will try my best to study.

## Kown the test

- about 30 minutes
- extra 10 minutes at the end
- 40 questions (get 30 right to 7 point)
- 4 sections of 10 questions
- answers are always in order
- only 3 main types of question (gap filling, multiple choice, matching)
- various English accent (don't worry, that will be slow)

You only hear the recordings once!

### Section 1

- two speakers
- ﻿﻿an 'everyday' conversation e.g. making a booking
- ﻿﻿one speaker gives basic information
- ﻿﻿simple gap-fill: missing details
- ﻿﻿names, addresses, dates, times, numbers
- ﻿﻿section 1 is easy, but you need a high score (9 or 10 correct)
