## gap filling

In the first video, he gave me an example of filling in the gaps, and do what I mentioned before. However, I found that sometimes it can be misleading, so we should be careful when two similar answers appear.



When you finish your reading practice, you should make a "keyword table" which has two columns: one for the keywords in the question and the other for similar words in the passage.

Such as:

| The keywords in question | Similar words in the passage |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| inside                   | containing                   |



## True or False or Not give

True / Yes - the correct information is given

False / No - different information is given, contradting the statement

Not given - we don't konw the answer, there isn't enough information



**Remeber**

Find the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully.

Answers are always in the correct order in the passage(for this type of question)
