## gap filling

In the first video, he gave me an example of filling in the gaps, and do what I mentioned before. However, I found that sometimes it can be misleading, so we should be careful when two similar answers appear.



When you finish your reading practice, you should make a "keyword table" which has two columns: one for the keywords in the question and the other for similar words in the passage.

Such as:

| The keywords in question | Similar words in the passage |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| inside                   | containing                   |



## True or False or Not give

True / Yes - the correct information is given

False / No - different information is given, contradting the statement

Not given - we don't konw the answer, there isn't enough information



**Remeber**

Find the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully.

Answers are always in the correct order in the passage(for this type of question)

 

## Matching paragraph headings

- ﻿﻿List of headings
- ﻿﻿Choose the best heading for each paragraph in the passage



'Paragraph headings' questions are difficult...

because the answers are not in order in the passage and because some of the headings may be similar



**Techniques**

1. Do 'paragraph headings' questions last

- ﻿﻿You will then be more familiar with the passage
- ﻿﻿You might get some of the answers from memory

2. ﻿﻿﻿Underline keywords' in each heading on the list

3. ﻿﻿﻿Then read the shortest or easiest paragraph

- ﻿﻿Read at normal speed
- ﻿﻿Underline the main ideas in the paragraph
- ﻿﻿Compare with all of the headings
- Choose the best one



## Which paragraph contains?

- List of statements
- ﻿﻿Find which paragraph contains the information in each statement

'Which paragraph contains' questions are difficult..

- ﻿﻿because the answers are **not in order** in the passage
- ﻿﻿the same paragraph may contain more than one answer
- ﻿﻿some of the paragraphs may not contain any answers

Techniques

1. Do which paragraph contains' questions last

- ﻿﻿Do all other questions for that passage first
- ﻿﻿You will then be more familiar with the passage
- ﻿﻿You might get some of the answers from memory

2. ﻿﻿﻿Underline 'keywords' in each statement

3. ﻿﻿﻿Then start with the easiest statement
