This small note references Simon's class, i watch the privated copies viedo from bilibili, so, sorry Mr. Simon, i will try my best to study.

1. Don't read the passage first
2. Just read the title
3. Then go to the first question
4. Underline 'keywords' in the question
5. Then serach for those words in the passage
6. Underline them
7. Read that part of the passage carefully
8. Try to get the answer



1. Read at normal speed
2. Only skim or scan for names or numbers
3. Miss any difficult questions, get to the end



## gap filling

In the first video, he gave me an example of filling in the gaps, and do what I mentioned before. However, I found that sometimes it can be misleading, so we should be careful when two similar answers appear.



When you finish your reading practice, you should make a "keyword table" which has two columns: one for the keywords in the question and the other for similar words in the passage.

Such as:

| The keywords in question | Similar words in the passage |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| inside                   | containing                   |



## True or False or Not give

True / Yes - the correct information is given

False / No - different information is given, contradting the statement

Not given - we don't konw the answer, there isn't enough information



**Remeber**

Find the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully.

Answers are always in the correct order in the passage(for this type of question)
